## 🌎 What is Connect Sphere?

**Connect Sphere** is a cost-free, peer-to-peer marketplace built exclusively for university communities. Forget sketchy public forums—Connect Sphere lets you buy, sell, and trade with other students at your school, all verified by your university email.

It's the faster, safer, and simpler way to find a textbook, sell your old couch, or grab a bike for campus.

## ✨ Features (Why It's Better)

* **🎓 Truly Hyperlocal:** The marketplace is built around *your* university. You're always dealing with fellow students.
* **🛒 Sell Anything. Beautifully.** Post new listings in seconds with our multi-image uploader and an "Amazon-style" image gallery.
* **💬 Instant Private Chat:** See an item you like? Click "Message Seller" to open a **persistent, real-time private chat** powered by Socket.io.
* **⭐ Build Your Reputation:** An "Inbox" and "Profile" page let you manage your listings, update your info, and track all your conversations in one place.
* **🔍 Find What You Need. Fast.** A powerful search bar and one-click category filters let you cut through the noise and find exactly what you're looking for.
* **🔒 Secure & Modern:** Built with a secure JWT authentication flow and a fully decoupled MERN stack architecture.
